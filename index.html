        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Scott Faust, and I'm on a journey to harness the transformative power of technology as a software engineer. My passion lies in not just understanding the intricacies of code but in using it as a tool to make a real-world impact.</p>
        <p>Born and raised in the nurturing environment of Denver, Colorado, my fascination with technology started at a young age. I found myself intrigued by the endless possibilities that software engineering presented – it was like having a language to converse with the future. Joining the Airforce right out of high school, I served as an Aircraft Mechanic, where I got my first hands-on experience with sophisticated technology. This experience wasn't just about understanding machinery; it was a lesson in precision, discipline, and the importance of every small part in a larger system.</p>
        <p>After my retirement in 2018, I embarked on a new mission – to become a software engineer. My journey at the University of Nebraska at Omaha isn't just an academic pursuit; it's a path to realizing my dream of making the world a better place. Here, I'm not only honing my skills in coding and software development but also learning how to leverage these skills to create accessible, user-friendly solutions.</p>
        <p>My vision is a world where technology is not just an elite privilege but a tool accessible to everyone, everywhere. I believe that in the right hands, technology can be a great equalizer, breaking down barriers and opening doors to limitless possibilities. Whether it's developing applications that improve everyday life, creating systems that make information more accessible, or contributing to groundbreaking innovations, I'm committed to using my skills for the greater good.</p>
        <p>As I stride forward in my career, I carry with me a commitment to excellence, a passion for learning, and a steadfast belief that technology, when used wisely and ethically, can indeed make the world a better place for all.</p>
